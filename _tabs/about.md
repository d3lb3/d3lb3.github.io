I am a 25 years old penetration tester, open source advocate and Python lover, currently working at Orange Cyberdefense.

During my computer science studies at INSA Lyon (France), I have been an active member of the computer club *Insecurity*, giving courses and participating in various Capture The Flag events. I also had the opportunity to study abroad at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Hungary) for a semester, where I attended CrySyS Lab courses, which were extremely valuable in my learning process.

I then worked as a penetration tester for various organizations such as Greater Lyon territorial collectivity, and now Orange Cyberdefense. After dozens of penetration testing assessments, I am spending more and more time in research & development. I took part of BOF project, featured at DEFCON 25, and am now focusing on password managers security. I also contributed to various open source projects including Scapy, Metasploit, CrackMapExec and Impacket.
