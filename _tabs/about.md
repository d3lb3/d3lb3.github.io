Since I was a child, I have always been deeply passionate about computers. After studying at INSA Lyon and Budapest University of Technology and Economics, I graduated in 2021 with a degree in computer engineering. Throughout my master's degree, I was the chairman of *InSecurity*, the university's computer club, giving courses and participating in various "Capture the Flag" events.

I then worked as a penetration tester for various organizations such as Greater Lyon territorial collectivity, and now Orange Cyberdefense.

In addition to security audits and red team engagements, I now spend more and more time on research and development. I have participated in studies featured at DEFCON, Pass The Salt, leHACK, BruCON, hack.lu and Black Hat MEA conferences as well as in MISC paper magazine.

I am also involved in open-source development, contributing to Metasploit, Scapy, Impacket, CrackMapExec and Exegol projects.
