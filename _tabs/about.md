Since I was very young, I have always been deeply passionate about computers. After studying at INSA Lyon (France) and Budapest University of  Technology and Economics (Hungary), I graduated in 2021 with a degree in computer engineering. Throughout my master's degree, I was also the chairman of *InSecurity*, my university's computer club, giving courses and participating in various "Capture the Flag" events.

I then worked as a penetration tester for various  organizations such as Greater Lyon territorial collectivity, and now  Orange Cyberdefense.

In addition to security audits, I now spend more and more time in research and development. I have participated in studies on BMS/CTM protocols (featured at DEFCON 25 and Pass The Salt conferences) as well as studies on password managers (presented at leHACK 2023 conference and MISC magazine).

I am also involved in open-source development, contributing to BOF, Metasploit, Scapy, Impacket, CrackMapExec and Exegol projects.
